# CKS Exam Domains & Competencies

| Cluster Setup | 15% |
| Use Network security policies to restrict cluster level access
| Use CIS benchmark to review the security configuration of Kubernetes components (etcd, kubelet, kubedns, kubeapi)
| Properly set up Ingress with TLS
| Protect node metadata and endpoints
| Verify platform binaries before deploying

| Cluster Hardening | 15% |
| Use Role Based Access Controls to minimize exposure
| Exercise caution in using service accounts e.g. disable defaults, minimize permissions on newly created ones
| Restrict access to Kubernetes API
| Upgrade Kubernetes to avoid vulnerabilities

| System Hardening | 10% |
| Minimize host OS footprint (reduce attack surface)
| Using least-privilege identity and access management
| Minimize external access to the network
| Appropriately use kernel hardening tools such as AppArmor, seccomp

| Minimize Microservice Vulnerabilities | 20% |
| Use appropriate pod security standards
| Manage Kubernetes secrets
| Understand and implement isolation techniques (multi-tenancy, sandboxed containers, etc.)
| Implement Pod-to-Pod encryption using Cilium

| Supply Chain Security | 20% |
| Minimize base image footprint
| Understand your supply chain (e.g. SBOM, CI/CD, artifact repositories)
| Secure your supply chain (permitted registries, sign and validate artifacts, etc.)
| Perform static analysis of user workloads and container images (e.g. Kubesec, KubeLinter)

| Monitoring, Logging and Runtime Security | 20% | 
| Perform behavioral analytics to detect malicious activities
| Detect threats within physical infrastructure, apps, networks, data, users and workloads
| Investigate and identify phases of attack and bad actors within the environment
| Ensure immutability of containers at runtime
| Use Kubernetes audit logs to monitor access
