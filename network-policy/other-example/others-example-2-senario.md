### **Example 2 Question**
This NetworkPolicy, named `internal-policy`, is applied in the `default` namespace and governs the network traffic for pods labeled with `name: internal`. It controls both **ingress** (incoming) and **egress** (outgoing) traffic for these pods.

#### **Key Rules:**
1. **Ingress (Incoming Traffic):**
   - **All incoming traffic is allowed** to the `internal` pods. This is specified by the `ingress: - {}` rule, which is permissive and does not restrict any source.

2. **Egress (Outgoing Traffic):**
   - The `internal` pods are allowed to communicate with:
     - Pods labeled `name: mysql` on **TCP port 3306** (typically used for MySQL databases).
     - Pods labeled `name: payroll` on **TCP port 8080** (likely a web or application service).
     - DNS servers on **UDP and TCP port 53** (required for DNS resolution).

---

### **Purpose of the Policy**
This policy ensures that:
- The `internal` pods can receive traffic from any source (no restrictions on ingress).
- The `internal` pods can only send traffic to specific services:
  - A MySQL database (`mysql` pods on port 3306).
  - A payroll service (`payroll` pods on port 8080).
  - DNS servers for name resolution (port 53).

All other outgoing traffic from the `internal` pods is blocked by default, as Kubernetes NetworkPolicy follows a "deny by default" approach for egress unless explicitly allowed.

---

### **Use Case**
This policy is likely used in a microservices architecture where:
- The `internal` pods represent an application or service that needs to interact with a MySQL database and a payroll service.
- The policy enforces strict network segmentation, ensuring that the `internal` pods can only communicate with the necessary services and nothing else.
- DNS access is allowed to enable service discovery and communication with external resources.

### **Summary Table**
| **Direction** | **Allowed Traffic**                                                                 |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ingress**   | All incoming traffic to `internal` pods.                                           |
| **Egress**    | - `mysql` pods on TCP port 3306.<br>- `payroll` pods on TCP port 8080.<br>- DNS on UDP/TCP port 53. |

This policy effectively restricts the `internal` pods to only communicate with the required services, enhancing security and reducing the attack surface.
