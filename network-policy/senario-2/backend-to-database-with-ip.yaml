# If you want to block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 and allow traffic from 192.168.0.0/16 and 10.96.0.0/12, we can achieve this by using the ipBlock field in Kubernetes Network Policies. Specifically, you will:
# Allow traffic from 192.168.0.0/16 and 10.96.0.0/12.
# Explicitly block traffic from 192.168.1.0/24 by excluding it from the allowed ranges.
# Pod with app=backend lable and app=batabase label and port 3306 in the namespace myapp
# We can only create ingress for both Backend and Database. But if Backend and Database need to connect outside cluster we must need to create Egress rules
