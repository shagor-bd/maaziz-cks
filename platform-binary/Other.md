# Platform Binary Integrity Verification

This guide explains how to verify the integrity of Kubernetes binaries using cryptographic hashes. Hashing ensures that the downloaded files are authentic and have not been tampered with.

---

## **What is a Hash?**
A **hash** is a fixed-length string generated from input data using a cryptographic algorithm. It serves as a unique identifier for data, ensuring integrity and verifying authenticity. Common hashing algorithms include **SHA-256**, **SHA-1**, and **MD5**.

## **Steps to Download and Verify Kubernetes Binaries**

### 1. **Download Kubernetes Release**
- Go to the [Kubernetes GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases) page.
- Navigate to the specific version (e.g., `v1.31.1`).
- Open the `CHANGELOG` and search for the version (e.g., `v1.31.1`).
- Locate the `Server Binaries` section to find the `sha512` hash for the desired binary (e.g., `kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz`).

### 2. **Download the Binary**
Use `wget` to download the binary:
```bash
wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.31.1/kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

### 3. **Verify the Hash**
- Compute the hash of the downloaded file:
  ```bash
  sha512sum kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz
  ```
- Compare the computed hash with the one from the GitHub page. If they match, the file is authentic and untampered.

#### **Quick Verification Trick**
1. Save the computed hash to a file:
   ```bash
   sha512sum kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz > hash-info
   ```
2. Paste the GitHub hash into the same file on the next line.
3. Keep the values only in `hash-info` file.
4. Run the following command to check for a match:
   ```bash
   cat hash-info | uniq
   ```
   - If the output shows only one line, the hashes match.

## **Verify API Server Binary Running Inside the Container**

### 1. **Extract the Downloaded File**
```bash
tar xzf kubernetes-server-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd kubernetes/server/bin
```

### 2. **Check the API Server Version**
```bash
./kube-apiserver --version
```
Output:
```
Kubernetes v1.31.1
```

### 3. **Get API Server Image Details**
```bash
kubectl -n kube-system get pods kube-apiserver-master -oyaml | grep image
```
Output:
```
image: registry.k8s.io/kube-apiserver:v1.31.1
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
imageID: registry.k8s.io/kube-apiserver@sha256:2409c23dbb5a2b7a81adbb184d3eac43ac653e9b97a7c0ee121b89bb3ef61fdb
```


### 4. **Compute the Hash from the Downloaded tar file**
```bash
sha512sum kube-apiserver
```
Output:
```

```

### 5. **Verify the Hash of the Running API Server Binary**
1. Find the API server process:
   ```bash
   pgrep -o kube-apiserver
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   1586
   ```
2. Locate the binary in the process's root directory:
   ```bash
   find /proc/1586/root/ | grep kube-apiserver
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   /proc/1586/root/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver
   ```
3. Compute the hash of the running binary:
   ```bash
   sha512sum /proc/1586/root/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   a6e6b01fc76f0f58a3f332442a927f1fefc2b6fb09c9683050426e47a5bcdaa9f7100713f3bc924ea27ba1c2ab28099644ce713f3d0ee957e0fdf99aa4aaab6d  /proc/1586/root/usr/local/bin/kube-apiserver
   ```
4. Compare this hash with the one from the downloaded binary. If they match, the running binary is authentic.

## **Conclusion**
By following these steps, you can ensure the integrity of Kubernetes binaries and verify that the files you download and run are authentic and untampered. This is a critical step in maintaining the security of your Kubernetes cluster.
